# 🧠 How this works (Real world)

# Pods expose 8080

# Service exposes 80

# Only accessible inside the cluster

# Pod (8080) ← Service (80) ← Other Pods
# A ClusterIP service exposes an application internally within the Kubernetes cluster and is commonly used for inter-service communication.
# 🔑 Golden rule to remember forever

# ✔ spec → ports → - port
# ✔ Service never runs containers
# ✔ Labels must match Pod labels exactly
